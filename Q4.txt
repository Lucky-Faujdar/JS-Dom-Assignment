Q4. Explain the purpose of the addEventListener method in JavaScript and how it facilitates event handling in the DOM.
ANSWER: 

The addEventListener() method is used to attach event handlers to DOM elements. It listens for a specific type of event (like click, mouseover, keydown, etc.) and then runs a specified function when that event occurs.

Syntax:

element.addEventListener('event', function, useCapture);

How it helps:

You can attach multiple listeners to a single element for the same or different events.

You can dynamically add or remove event listeners at runtime.

It supports both event bubbling and event capturing by using the third optional parameter.

Unlike inline event handlers (onclick="..."), it separates HTML and JavaScript, promoting cleaner code.


Example:

const btn = document.getElementById('myBtn');
btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Button was clicked!');
});

This method allows developers to make web pages more interactive and responsive to user actions.
