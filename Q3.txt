Q3. Explain the concept of Event Bubbling in the DOM.
ANSWER: 

Event bubbling is a behavior in the DOM where an event starts at the target element and then moves upwards through the hierarchy, triggering any event handlers set on the elementâ€™s ancestors.

Example:

If a user clicks on a <span> inside a <div>, the click event is first handled by the <span>, then the <div>, then its parent, and so on up to the <body>.

Use Cases:

Enables event delegation by allowing a single listener on a parent to detect actions on child elements.

Helps manage events efficiently, especially in large applications.


document.getElementById('outerDiv').addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Div clicked');
});

If a button inside outerDiv is clicked, the alert will still run due to event bubbling.
