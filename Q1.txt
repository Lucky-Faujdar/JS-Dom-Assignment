Q1. Explain the DOM and its role in Web development.
ANSWER: 

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a tree-like structure that represents the content of a web page in a hierarchical form. When a web page is loaded in the browser, the HTML is converted into the DOM by the browser’s engine.

Each element in HTML—like headings, paragraphs, images, buttons—is turned into an object or node in the DOM. These objects can be accessed and manipulated using programming languages like JavaScript.

Role in Web Development:

Dynamic Interactions: JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically change the text, structure, and appearance of elements.

Content Manipulation: Developers can use the DOM to insert, delete, or modify HTML elements and content.

Style Updates: It allows changes in CSS styles through JavaScript for effects like animations or theme changes.

User Interactions: DOM plays a key role in handling events like mouse clicks, keyboard input, and form submissions.


In short, the DOM acts as a bridge between HTML content and JavaScript, enabling rich and interactive user experiences.
